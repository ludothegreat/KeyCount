    No error handling - The code could fail silently at several points like reading the config file, Git operations, keyboard listening etc. Try/except blocks should be added for robustness.
    Race conditions - The pressed_keys set is shared between the key press and release handlers without locks. This could lead to race conditions where a key is added and removed at the same time. Could use a threading.Lock here.
    Combination keys - The combination key logic may have bugs when multiple keys are pressed together. Thorough testing is needed.
    Global state - The use of global variables for state like pressed_keys and last_save_time makes the code harder to reason about. Could refactor to reduce globals.
    Git repository - The code just initializes a Git repo in the local directory without considering if one already exists. This could overwrite previous commits.
    Path handling - The file paths are hardcoded and may not work on different OSes. Should use os.path.join() etc for portable paths.
    CPU usage - The constant keyboard listening and processing may consume significant CPU. Could optimize the handlers.
    Data loss - If the program crashes, recent key presses could be lost before the next save. Could periodically save to a temp file.
